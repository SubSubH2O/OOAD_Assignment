we do only 1 board behind the game, the gui is just showing the board, it will have a function in Game to draw the board


1. everyturn the bord will rotate
    - this will need a function

2. for the game to determine the pieces on the board
    - a function in GUI class will be called to get the coordinates (start and destination)
    - when the button(the board) is clicked, the button will turn color to indicate the clicked pieces
    - if no piece, do nothing
    - also maybe the hover effect (OPTIONAL)

3. a function in Game to draw the board
    - in 2, thr pieces is selected, it will get the valid move from the pieces class, is the destination valid or not

4. what will the player do
    - look at the board (set it to the player turn)
    - decide which piece to move 
    - take the piece (player movePiece(which piece it is, and the destination))
    - put it to the destination (same as above)
    - drop the piece
    - if there is piece on the position, and the piece is not the player'same (checkGotPiece(which place is the position))
    - the piece disappear from the board, and the opponent loss a piece (player lossPiece(which place is the position))
    -
